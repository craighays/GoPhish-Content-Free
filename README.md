# GoPhish-Content-Free
This is a library of GoPhish content that I create which is available for anyone to use, for free, for legitimate and authorised testing only. Do with it as you will but I take no responsibility for your actions.

## Emails
This directory contains GoPhish email templates including the {{}} placeholders for automatically generated values. You can edit these or use as is. 

Many of these emails are clones of legitimate emails from the imitated companies but with subtle clues to give people a chance to guess that they're being phished. Being the best phisher you can be isn't the goal of phishing simulation testing - it's the learning and feedback that people take away from it.

## Landing Pages
I usually just clone landing pages direct from the legit sites that I'm imitating. Any bespoke landing pages will appear here.

## Training Content
Any training content I choose to make free for public use will appear here. Use at your own risk.

# Summary
Don't be stupid. Do not go directly to jail. Use this to make the world a better place, not a worse one. 

Use at your own risk. I take no responsibility for whatever you do with this. Don't be stupid.
